# Experiments-in-CounterStrike
This Project will focus on image classification to classify Terrorists and Counter Terrorists, using default algorithms from Tensorflow Model Zoo.
Future developement will hopefully include a Visual Positioning System for the bot to detect and kill opponents. 

The repository provides all the files needed to train a "Counter Strike" Terrorist/Counter Terrorist detector that can detect Terrorists and Counter Terrorists.

Requirements:
Python 3
Tensorflow Object Detection API
